Thus, Touba&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> to the one whom Allah has placed the keys to goodness in his hands, and woe to the one whom Allah has placed the keys to evil in his hands.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One who wishes to be counted among the keys to goodness and the locks of evil must:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Show sincerity towards Allah in his words and actions, for it is the foundation of all good and the source of all virtue.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Invoke and implore Allah persistently to achieve this, for supplication is the key to all good, and Allah does not reject a servant who invokes Him, nor does He disappoint a believer who implores Him.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Be diligent in seeking and acquiring knowledge, for knowledge calls to virtues and nobilities, while preserving from vices and grave sins.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Dedicate oneself to the worship of Allah, especially the obligations, and especially the prayer, for it keeps one away from obscenity and reprehensible acts.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Cultivate noble eminent characters, while avoiding infamous and blameworthy characters.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Associate with the best and sit with the pious, for their gatherings are surrounded by angels and enveloped in mercy, while being wary of those of the wicked and depraved upon whom descend the devils.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Advise the servants when one associates and interacts with them, encouraging them to do good and turning them away from evil.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Remember the day of return when one will stand before the Lord of the universes. He will then reward the benefactor for his beneficence, and the malefactor for his malefaction: &amp;ldquo;Whoever does an atom&amp;rsquo;s weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom&amp;rsquo;s weight of evil will see it.&amp;rdquo; [Surah 99, v.7-8]&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>All of this rests upon the sincere desire of the servant to do good and be beneficial to others. When this desire is present, the intention is firm, the determination is assured, and he seeks Allah&amp;rsquo;s help for it while undertaking things as they should be, then, by Allah&amp;rsquo;s will, he will count among the keys to goodness and the locks of evil.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>And it is Allah who takes charge of granting success to His servants. He opens to whomever He wills in truth, He is the best of Fatihin&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>[NDT] This term has been interpreted in various ways by scholars. Some have affirmed that it refers to paradise, while others have advanced that it designates a tree in paradise whose shade extends a distance traveled in a hundred years, and from which the inhabitants of paradise draw their clothes, as explicit hadiths report. Another interpretation suggests that the root of this term evokes what is good, thus announcing a good life in this world and in the hereafter. This last explanation is the most exhaustive, as highlighted by Sheikh Mohammed Al &amp;lsquo;Othaymine, may Allah have mercy on him.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>[NDT] Al Fatah is one of the sublime names of Allah which encompasses several meanings.

Judge between us and our people in truth, for You are the best of those who judge&amp;rdquo; [Surah 7:39]. He is also the one who opens the doors of sustenance and mercies: &amp;ldquo;Whatever mercy (i.e., good) Allah may grant to mankind, none can withhold it, and whatever He may withhold, none can grant it thereafter.

May prayers and peace be upon the noblest of messengers. With that being said:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are important principles for understanding, grasping innovation, and responding to it, all while understanding the essence of the Sounnah. If the student of knowledge masters them, then they will have acquired abundant blessings, and Allah will have opened for them a great door in understanding what innovation and the Sounnah truly are. They will be able to respond to the greatest innovators on this earth with these principles, providing compelling and irrefutable arguments.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-first-foundation">The First Foundation
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The first foundation in the prohibition of innovation lies in the words of the Most High (in approximate translation):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Today I have perfected for you your religion, completed My favor upon you, and have approved for you Islam as religion.&amp;rdquo; [Surah 5,v. 3]&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>First:
To any innovator, ask them: &amp;ldquo;Is what you do an act of worship or a lack of behavior?&amp;rdquo; They cannot say it&amp;rsquo;s a lack of behavior; they will definitely say it&amp;rsquo;s worship. This is the first point: asking them this question.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Second:
Ask them: &amp;ldquo;Is your religion complete, or is it still deficient?&amp;rdquo; They cannot say it&amp;rsquo;s deficient; they will rather say it&amp;rsquo;s complete. This is the second point. Then, bring them to the third subject.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Third:
Ask them: &amp;ldquo;This innovation you have made, either you affirm that the religion was deficient and you completed it with this innovation, or this religion is already perfected, so beware of novelties.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;All good is in following those who preceded,
While all evil is in the innovation of those who succeeded.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our Cheikh, Cheikh Mohammed Aman Ibn &amp;lsquo;Ali Al Jami, may Allah have mercy on him, repeated this verse and said: &amp;ldquo;It is the most truthful verse in (the poem) Jawahir Al Tawhid, which is about the Ash&amp;rsquo;arite belief.&amp;rdquo; He also said: &amp;ldquo;If only he had applied this verse to his belief, as it attested to the belief of those who succeeded.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the first foundation, which you argue by this verse.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-second-foundation">The Second Foundation
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The second foundation by which you refute innovation and silence the greatest innovators is the saying of the Prophet: &amp;ldquo;Whoever introduces into our matter (religion) something that is not part of it, it will be rejected.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You say: &amp;ldquo;Is this thing part of our matter (religion)? Bring the proof. If you say it&amp;rsquo;s a novelty, then I say it&amp;rsquo;s rejected, as clearly stated in the hadith.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-third-foundation">The Third Foundation
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The Prophet used to repeat in every Friday sermon: &amp;ldquo;Beware of new things, for every novelty (in religion) is innovation, and every innovation is misguidance.&amp;rdquo; He reiterated this statement to the extent that the young companions memorized it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I consciously used to add &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo;, saying: &amp;ldquo;and every innovation is good.&amp;rdquo; People would correct me, even in Africa, which proves that people know the hadith. They say: &amp;ldquo;No, brother Ibrahim, every innovation is misguidance.&amp;rdquo; So, praises are due to Allah. Okay, then why, when you are informed that this innovation is misguidance, do you respond: &amp;ldquo;No, our Cheikh, he says it&amp;rsquo;s a good innovation&amp;rdquo;? By Allah, people laughed, for we confronted them with the pure nature (Fitrah). We say your prophet says every innovation is misguidance, while you say: &amp;ldquo;No, by Allah, he said it&amp;rsquo;s a good innovation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-fourth-foundation">The Fourth Foundation
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We say: &amp;ldquo;The acts of worship with which the Prophet came, did they come from himself, or were they the fruit of revelation from heaven?&amp;rdquo; He will respond that it is a revelation from heaven. Then, you say to him: &amp;ldquo;Give me evidence.&amp;rdquo; He will say: &amp;ldquo;He does not speak out of desire, it is only a revelation&amp;rdquo; [Surah 53,v. 3]. Okay, your worship that you have innovated, was it descended upon you by a revelation from the heavens? Whereas revelation has ended (after the death of the Prophet).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-fifth-foundation">The Fifth Foundation
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is a response to an ambiguity. They say: &amp;ldquo;Why do you criticize when we do good things like celebrating the Prophet&amp;rsquo;s birth (Mawlid)? We remember his biography, study it, and our faith increases in our hearts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The response to this is that: &amp;ldquo;Not every good-looking thing can be used to worship Allah.&amp;rdquo; The proof of this is the hadith of the three individuals, where the first said: &amp;ldquo;As for me, I will pray the entire night.&amp;rdquo; The other said: &amp;ldquo;I will fast continuously.&amp;rdquo; The last said: &amp;ldquo;For my part, I will avoid women and never marry.&amp;rdquo; The Messenger of Allah then came to them and said: &amp;ldquo;Is it indeed you who said this and that? By Allah, I fear Allah more than you, but I fast at times and break it at others. I pray part of the night and sleep another, and I marry women. Whoever turns away from my Sounnah is not of me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note, when the matter was serious and concerned a novelty in religion, he ascended the pulpit. So, the rule is that &amp;ldquo;just because something seems good on the surface does not mean it can be used to worship Allah.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-sixth-foundation">The Sixth Foundation
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Worship, if it lacks the condition of conformity (to the model of the Prophet), then it is never called worship, even if you worship Allah a hundred times with this worship, and the proof of this is the hadith of the one who performed prayer incorrectly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From where did we extract the argumentative witness (from the hadith)? The man prayed with certainty, and the Prophet spoke the truth in saying: &amp;ldquo;You did not pray.&amp;rdquo; How then can you reconcile two things that oppose and contradict each other in appearance?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer: since he did not pray in accordance with the Sounnah, following the prayer of the Prophet, then it was not considered worship, it was as if he had not prayed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we say: &amp;ldquo;Your innovation by which you wanted to worship Allah is not considered worship, even if you call it so.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-seventh-foundation">The Seventh Foundation
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This foundation, in itself, holds great importance, allowing us to refute innovation. It affirms: &amp;ldquo;The Prophet showed the community the good he knew and warned against the evil he knew. The greatest evils he warned against are shirk and innovation.&amp;rdquo; The proof is in the authentic hadith of Mouslim, where the Prophet said: &amp;ldquo;It was the duty of every prophet to show his community the good he knew and to warn them against the evil he knew.&amp;rdquo; So, we worship Allah on this basis and attest that our Prophet guided the community to all good and warned it against all evil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we say to the innovator: &amp;ldquo;Is your innovation a good thing (known to the Prophet)?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If he answers yes, then we say: &amp;ldquo;Bring evidence (of the revelation) that this is indeed the case. Initially, you qualified it as innovation simply because it is new.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If he answers no, then we tell him that two possibilities are open to you:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You assert that the Prophet was unaware of this good and that you were the first to reveal it, along with the other impostors.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You assert that the Prophet concealed this (so-called) good, so the saying of Imam Malik applies to you: &amp;ldquo;Whoever innovates in Islam and sees that his innovation is good, has indeed claimed that Mohammed betrayed the message of prophethood.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>An Athar that supports and testifies to this foundation is the saying of Ibn Mas&amp;rsquo;oud, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: &amp;ldquo;By Him in Whose hand is my soul, you are on a path whose guidance is better than Mohammed&amp;rsquo;s religion, or you are opening a door of misguidance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our Prophet guided the community to all good and warned it against all evil. So either your path is on better guidance than that of the Prophet, or you are opening a door of misguidance.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-eighth-foundation">The Eighth Foundation
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is a response to an ambiguity that seeks to justify their innovations, like the Mawlid, by the hadith: &amp;ldquo;Whoever introduces into Islam a good tradition will have its reward and the reward of those who act according to it, without that detracting from their rewards in the slightest.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We do not say: &amp;ldquo;So woe to those who pray&amp;rdquo; [Surah 107,v. 4], and then stop here. The meaning of the Prophet&amp;rsquo;s saying: &amp;ldquo;Whoever introduces into Islam a good tradition&amp;rdquo; becomes clear if you come with the complete hadith. But to quote the hadith to take what you like and leave what testifies against you, this is not permissible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This hadith is related to a story. A group of people, poor, wearing tattered clothes, and hungry came to the Prophet. When he saw their state of need, he changed his expression. And he is the most compassionate and generous of creatures towards creation. Then the call to group prayer was made, when the people gathered, he commanded and encouraged them to give charity. A man brought a bag of food that he could not carry with his hand; he put it in front of the Prophet. Seeing this, the companions followed him in this gate of good that he had opened, some came with a bushel of wheat, barley, dates&amp;hellip; until two large quantities of food and clothing were gathered near the Prophet. It was then that he said: &amp;ldquo;Whoever introduces into Islam a good tradition.&amp;rdquo; By this, he aimed at the first who had brought a bag filled with food that he could not carry. It is not intended by this text that you invent a Tijani, Naqshbandi, etc., way, and then say: &amp;ldquo;Whoever introduces into Islam a good tradition.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-ninth-foundation">The Ninth Foundation
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This foundation is a response to the innovation of specification, which consists of introducing a specific worship, at a defined time, and in a particular form. This worship is rejected and not accepted. For example: specifying Friday night for night prayer and fasting on this day. The Prophet prohibited such practice. The proof is that he said: &amp;ldquo;Do not specify Friday night among other nights by staying up in prayer, and do not specify Friday by fasting, except if it is included in continuous fasting.&amp;rdquo; Reported by Mouslim.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;When the servant says: &amp;lsquo;There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah, Allah is the Greatest,&amp;rsquo; Allah says: &amp;lsquo;My servant speaks the truth: there is no deity worthy of worship except Me, and I am Allah, the Greatest.&amp;rsquo;
And when the servant says: &amp;lsquo;There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah alone,&amp;rsquo; Allah says: &amp;lsquo;My servant speaks the truth: there is no deity worthy of worship except Me alone.&amp;rsquo;
And when the servant says: &amp;lsquo;There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah, without any partners,&amp;rsquo; Allah says: &amp;lsquo;My servant speaks the truth: there is no deity worthy of worship except Me, and I have no partners.&amp;rsquo;
And when the servant says: &amp;lsquo;There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah, to Him belongs sovereignty and praise,&amp;rsquo; Allah says: &amp;lsquo;My servant speaks the truth: there is no deity worthy of worship except Me, sovereignty and praise belong to Me.&amp;rsquo;
And when the servant says: &amp;lsquo;There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah, there is no changing of conditions and strength except by Allah,&amp;rsquo; Allah says: &amp;lsquo;My servant speaks the truth: there is no deity worthy of worship except Me, there is no changing of state nor strength except by Me.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Abou Ishaq said: &amp;ldquo;Then, Al Aghar said something that I did not understand.&amp;rdquo; I asked Abou Ja&amp;rsquo;far, &amp;ldquo;What did he say?&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;Those to whom these [words] are granted at the time of their death will not be touched by the fire.&amp;rdquo;
Tirmidhi also reported it in the chapter: &amp;ldquo;What the servant should say when he is sick.&amp;rdquo; He reported it with the phrase: &amp;ldquo;Whoever says them when he is sick and dies, the fire will not touch him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Al-Nasa&amp;rsquo;i also reported it and added: &amp;ldquo;He counts them as five by folding his fingers (toward his palm).&amp;rdquo; He also said in another narration: &amp;ldquo;Allah supports His servant with five statements that he utters.&amp;rdquo; Then he mentioned them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ibn Al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy upon him, declared while enumerating the benefits of the remembrance (of Allah): &amp;ldquo;The remembrance is a cause for the Lord to bear witness to the truthfulness of His servant. The forms of remembrance declare His attributes of perfection and His attributes of majesty. Thus, when the servant mentions them, his Lord confirms his words. Whoever the Lord attests to his truthfulness will not be gathered with the liars; it is hoped that he will be grouped with the truthful.&amp;rdquo; And he cited this hadith. He also said, may Allah have mercy upon him: &amp;ldquo;And among His love, pure is He, is the praise that is given to Him. He confirms the one who praises Him through His attributes of perfection.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ibn Hibban thus classified this hadith in his authentic work, in the chapter: &amp;ldquo;Mention of the words that the Muslim says and that his Lord, exalted and elevated is He, confirms.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regarding this statement: &amp;ldquo;The one to whom these words are granted at the time of his death will not be touched by the fire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Al Sindi, may Allah have mercy upon him, commented in his annotations to the Sunan of Ibn Majah: &amp;ldquo;This means that whoever is granted by Allah the privilege of these statements, and He guides him to pronounce them at the time of his death, the fire will not touch him. On the contrary, he will immediately enter Paradise with the virtuous. O Lord, grant us these statements.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Al-Shawkani, may Allah have mercy upon him, declared in Touhfat Al Dhakirin: &amp;ldquo;The meaning of this is that these statements encompass Tawhid five times. It has been established in authentic hadiths that whoever dies without associating anything with Allah will enter Paradise. We will mention (the hadith): &amp;lsquo;Whoever&amp;rsquo;s final words are &amp;lsquo;La Ilaha Illa Allah&amp;rsquo; [There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah] will enter Paradise.&amp;rsquo; He reported numerous hadiths in this sense, according to a large number of companions, from authentic sources and others.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Al-Moubarakfouri, may Allah have mercy upon him, said in Mara&amp;rsquo;at: &amp;ldquo;This hadith is evidence that if an individual utters these words while sick and dies as a result of that sickness, having pronounced them—that is, these are the last words he utters consciously and carefully—the fire will not touch him, and he will not be affected by his past sins, for they expiate all sins.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Cheikh Al &amp;lsquo;Otheimine, may Allah have mercy upon him, said in his explanation of Riyad Al Salihin: &amp;ldquo;It is fitting for the individual to memorize this remembrance and to recite it frequently when he is ill, until he attains a good end by the permission of Allah the Most High, and success comes from Allah.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>My father, Cheikh &amp;lsquo;Abd Al Mouhsin Al Badr, may Allah preserve him, dictated this to me: &amp;ldquo;This is a great remembrance, reported by certain authors of the Sunan and others, which has been authenticated by a group of scholars. It consists of five Tahlilat (declarations of the testimony of faith &amp;lsquo;La Ilaha Illa Allah&amp;rsquo;) and is accompanied by praise to Allah, as befits His greatness. Imam Al Bukhari, may Allah have mercy upon him, concluded his authentic collection with the hadith of Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, in which the Messenger said: &amp;ldquo;Two statements that are light on the tongue, heavy on the scale, beloved to the Most Merciful: &amp;lsquo;SubhanAllah Al &amp;lsquo;Azim, SubhanAllah Wa Bihamdihi&amp;rsquo;. These five Tahlilat are suitable to be described by these three characteristics mentioned in this hadith. My son, &amp;lsquo;Abd Al Razzaq, may Allah preserve him, has done well to mention and disseminate this hadith, and the reminding profits the believers. Therefore, it is imperative for the Muslim to pay attention to this remembrance, especially in the case of illness. Allah is the One who grants success.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Cheikh Ahmad Abou &amp;lsquo;Oubaydah Al Mahrazzi Al Mourrakachi, may Allah have mercy upon him, greatly recommended this invocation, which he called &amp;ldquo;the recitation of approaching death.&amp;rdquo; He said: &amp;ldquo;Do not neglect the recitation of approaching death and always keep it in mind.&amp;rdquo; He explained the difference between this invocation and the hadith: &amp;ldquo;Whoever&amp;rsquo;s final words are &amp;lsquo;La Ilaha Illa Allah&amp;rsquo; will enter Paradise.&amp;rdquo; He emphasized: &amp;ldquo;Paradise can be reached after prior punishment, but here, there is no prior punishment, for it is said &amp;rsquo;the fire will not touch him&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo; He affirmed: &amp;ldquo;These five statements, at the time of death, constitute the greatest and most precious provision.&amp;rdquo; Allah honored him by making them the last words he uttered in this world. Moreover, he made them pronounced by another dying person who was at his bedside, so they became their last words. Thus, a dying person made these statements pronounced by another dying person. May Allah forgive both of them, as well as all deceased Muslims.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This remembrance is great and blessed. Every Muslim should take care of it and recite it abundantly. It should be considered an objective and aspiration. One hopes that Allah will enable him to pronounce them at the time of his death, in order to have a good end and to enter Paradise immediately with the virtuous, without the fire touching him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Success is from Allah alone, with no partner.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Honorable Cheikh, may Allah grant you success, does loving to see forbidden images that
can be found on phones, on the internet, and constantly desiring them, fall under the
forms of Shirk where the person becomes an idolater of these images?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="answer">Answer
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Yes, it is a form of Shirk of desire. A form of Shirk of desire because he desires these
images. These images take his heart, and he follows them as a result. It is a minor
form of Shirk.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That I swear by Allah while lying is preferable to me than to swear by anything else
while speaking the truth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a great saying by &amp;lsquo;Abd Allah Ibn Massou&amp;rsquo;d, may Allah be pleased with both of them.
It testifies to the perfect understanding of the companions, the special attention they
paid to Tawhid, and also the care given to the terms used, while taking care and warning
against it. He spoke these blessed great words, which show, as I said, the great
perception of the companions and the special attention they paid to the Tawhid of Allah.
He said, may Allah be pleased with him:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That I swear by Allah while lying is preferable to me than to swear by anything else
while speaking the truth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now meditate on the first word and the second, weigh them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first word: &amp;ldquo;That I swear by Allah while lying.&amp;rdquo; The second word: &amp;ldquo;Than to swear by
anything else while speaking the truth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compare the two words to observe this remarkable sagacity. Each of these two words
contains a good action and a bad one. The first phrase contains a good and a bad action.
Similarly, for the second, there is also a good action and a bad one. The first word: &amp;quot;
That I swear by Allah while lying,&amp;quot; there is the good action of Tawhid and the bad one
which is lying. For the second word &amp;ldquo;that to swear by anything else while speaking the
truth,&amp;rdquo; there is the bad action of Shirk and the good action of truthfulness. Now that
this reality has become manifest to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A word that contains the good action of Tawhid or the bad action of Shirk?! We seek refuge
in Allah from Shirk, we seek refuge in Allah from Shirk. If you look at the bad actions,
lying is less serious than Shirk. Similarly, the good action of Tawhid is more prominent
than that of truthfulness. Then note this intense perception, he said:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That I swear by Allah while lying is preferable to me than to swear by anything else
while speaking the truth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the oath by anything other than Allah is Shirk, and the great sin of Shirk is more
important and even more serious than that of lying. This is the perception of the
companions, may Allah be pleased with them.&lt;/p>

He afflicts them with difficulty and harm, then welcomes them as refugees in His Tawhid.
They then sincerely invoke Him, devotionally worshiping Him alone, and place their hopes
in Him alone and their hearts are attached to Him and no one else. This gives rise to
complete trust in Allah, returning repentantly and obediently to Him, the sweetness of
faith and its taste, as well as renouncing shirk. This is even more beneficial for them
than being freed from affliction by illness, fear, hunger, drought, or even the arrival of
ease and the disappearance of difficulty in this worldly life. For all of these things are
worldly pleasures and benefits, which disbelievers can have much more than believers. But
what happens to the people of Tawhid, those who exclusively worship Allah, is more
grandiose than what words can express or the mind can detail. Each believer will have a
share of this according to their faith.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The twelve months of the year are comparable to the children of Ya&amp;rsquo;qoub. And the month of
Ramadan among the other months is like Youssouf among his brothers. In the same way that
Youssouf is the most beloved child with Ya&amp;rsquo;qoub, Ramadan is the most beloved month with
the Knower of the unseen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Youssouf&amp;rsquo;s brothers came relying on him to fill the gaps and remove the harms, after being
in error and fault. He welcomed them in the best way and improved their situations, he fed
them when they were hungry and allowed them to return home. So, one individual solved the
problems of eleven people. That is the month of Ramadan, we hope to regain our
shortcomings from other months and rectify the bad things, so that Allah grants us a good
end with joy and happiness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And another indication is that Ya&amp;rsquo;qoub regained his sight when he smelled Youssouf. He
became strong after being weak, seeing after being blind. This is also the case for the
sinner when he smells Ramadan.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>May Allah be benevolent towards you and make you profitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A belief-related issue has left me confused, it concerns the request for invocation to a
deceased person. I found a statement from Cheikh Mohammed Bazmoul, may Allah preserve him,
which says in essence that the request for invocation to a deceased person near their
grave, without any attribution of the specificities of Allah, is considered as an
innovated Tawassoul and prohibited. After thorough research, I found this statement among
some people of knowledge who also affirm it, and there are people of knowledge who
consider it as major Shirk which takes one out of Islam. I hope for clarification on this
point, may Allah record your reward. Does the divergence rest on the question of whether
the dead can hear the living or not?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>May Allah be benevolent towards you and make you profitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="answer">Answer
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Indeed, as you have mentioned, there is a divergence among people of knowledge on this
question: the request for invocation to a deceased person. What appears, is that this is
major Shirk which takes one out of Islam. We seek refuge with Allah. Indeed, he has not
asked without having the conviction that he can respond, that he holds the ability to
respond to his wish. Otherwise, this is foolishness and transgression.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I questioned some scholars on this subject &lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. There is a statement from Cheikh Al Islam
in Al Fatawa, in which he mentioned three categories including this one. He qualified it
as innovation. However, he also said in Iqtidâ As-Sirât Al-Moustaqîm Moukhâlafat &amp;lsquo;Asshâb
Al-Djahîm, that this is what the Christians did with Jesus, and that it is an innovation.
We thus understand that the statement of Cheikh Al Islam in Al Fatawa denotes innovation
leading to the disbelief of its author, and not an innovation that does not reach the
degree of disbelief. We must understand this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Indeed, some scholars do not see the act of asking for invocation to the dead as major
Shirk, but rather an innovation and a path leading to Shirk. However, if it is said that
the dead can hear the living as some scholars have stated, this goes against the majority
of evidence, which suggests that the dead cannot hear. The only exceptions are specific
instances such as the sound of sandals leaving the cemeteries and the infidel dead at
Badr, as reported by Al Boukhary. Omar said to the prophet ﷺ: &amp;ldquo;Are you talking to dead
people?&amp;rdquo; The prophet ﷺ replied: &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t hear better than them&amp;rdquo; and in an authentic
hadith: &amp;ldquo;While he can hear the sound of their sandals.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, these are specific situations, and there is no general evidence for it. Allah
says:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You cannot make the dead hear&amp;rdquo; [Surah Al Naml, v.80]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You cannot make those in the graves hear&amp;rdquo; [Surah Fatir, v.22]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if it is affirmed that they hear, the question remains: are they capable of
responding to the person asking for invocation? Clearly, nobody says that. That&amp;rsquo;s why the
most correct opinion is that it&amp;rsquo;s a form of shirk, and refuge should be sought with
Allah.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>What are the degrees of religion, citing for each one its pillars?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>May Allah reward you well&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="answer">Answer
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The degrees of religion are three; Islam, faith and excellence as shown by the prophet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first degree, Islam which is the general degree. Its pillars are five in number :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the testimony that none is worthy of worship except Allah and that Mohammed is the
messenger of Allah;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the performance of prayer;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>giving the mandatory charity;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the fast of the month of Ramadan;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the pilgrimage to the sacred house.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Any work that Allah has legislated falls under Islam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second degree, faith. Its pillars are six in number :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>that you believe in Allah;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>his angels;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>his books;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>his messengers;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the day of judgment;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the good or bad destiny.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The third degree, excellence. It has a single pillar :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>its meaning is &amp;ldquo;that you worship Allah as if you see Him, because if you do not see Him,
He sees you&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All good works fall under Islam and faith. If the believer combines all apparent and
hidden works, he becomes a Muslim believer. And if he worships Allah as if he sees Him,
because if he does not see Him, Allah sees him, he becomes thus a Muslim believer and
Mouhsin (degree of excellence).&lt;/p>

pronouncing both or by inclusion. If the statement that no deity deserves worship except
Allah is cited alone, then it includes the statement that Muhammad is the messenger of
Allah.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The statement that no deity deserves worship except Allah [La ilaha ila Allah] is not
valid without the statement that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. It is not accepted,
and the Islam of one who denies the message of Muhammad is not judged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The meaning of Muhammad is the messenger of Allah is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>recognition of his message both in an apparent and hidden way;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>obedience to what he ordered;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>making true what he informed;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>staying away from what he prohibited and reprimanded;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>that Allah should be worshipped only by what he legislated.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Also recognizing the universality of his message, intended for both jinns and humans. He
is the last prophet, there is no prophet after him until the day of judgement.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Is it permissible to swear by the Quran, meaning by this, the word which is an attribute
of Allah?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="answer">Answer
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>It is permissible to swear by the Quran, as long as the subject of the oath is the word of
Allah. The Quran is indeed the word of Allah, it says &amp;ldquo;By the Quran&amp;rdquo;, as it could say &amp;ldquo;By
the word of Allah&amp;rdquo;. Since the Quran is part of the word of Allah, the oath by the Quran is
therefore an oath made by one of the attributes of Allah. However, one does not swear by
the Mushaf. One does not say &amp;ldquo;By the Mushaf&amp;rdquo;, because it contains the word of Allah and
what is not part of it. It contains the written word of Allah, but also the ink, which is
created. The pages are also created, as well as the cover. There is in the Mushaf what is
not created and what is. That&amp;rsquo;s why you should not swear by the Mushaf. However, if the
oath is made by the Quran, in the sense of the word of Allah and not the Mushaf, then this
is valid.&lt;/p>
