&lt;p>The twelve months of the year are comparable to the children of Ya&amp;rsquo;qoub. And the month of
Ramadan among the other months is like Youssouf among his brothers. In the same way that
Youssouf is the most beloved child with Ya&amp;rsquo;qoub, Ramadan is the most beloved month with
the Knower of the unseen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Youssouf&amp;rsquo;s brothers came relying on him to fill the gaps and remove the harms, after being
in error and fault. He welcomed them in the best way and improved their situations, he fed
them when they were hungry and allowed them to return home. So, one individual solved the
problems of eleven people. That is the month of Ramadan, we hope to regain our
shortcomings from other months and rectify the bad things, so that Allah grants us a good
end with joy and happiness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And another indication is that Ya&amp;rsquo;qoub regained his sight when he smelled Youssouf. He
became strong after being weak, seeing after being blind. This is also the case for the
sinner when he smells Ramadan.&lt;/p>
