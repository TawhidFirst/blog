Thus, Touba&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> to the one whom Allah has placed the keys to goodness in his hands, and woe to the one whom Allah has placed the keys to evil in his hands.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One who wishes to be counted among the keys to goodness and the locks of evil must:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Show sincerity towards Allah in his words and actions, for it is the foundation of all good and the source of all virtue.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Invoke and implore Allah persistently to achieve this, for supplication is the key to all good, and Allah does not reject a servant who invokes Him, nor does He disappoint a believer who implores Him.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Be diligent in seeking and acquiring knowledge, for knowledge calls to virtues and nobilities, while preserving from vices and grave sins.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Dedicate oneself to the worship of Allah, especially the obligations, and especially the prayer, for it keeps one away from obscenity and reprehensible acts.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Cultivate noble eminent characters, while avoiding infamous and blameworthy characters.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Associate with the best and sit with the pious, for their gatherings are surrounded by angels and enveloped in mercy, while being wary of those of the wicked and depraved upon whom descend the devils.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Advise the servants when one associates and interacts with them, encouraging them to do good and turning them away from evil.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Remember the day of return when one will stand before the Lord of the universes. He will then reward the benefactor for his beneficence, and the malefactor for his malefaction: &amp;ldquo;Whoever does an atom&amp;rsquo;s weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom&amp;rsquo;s weight of evil will see it.&amp;rdquo; [Surah 99, v.7-8]&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>All of this rests upon the sincere desire of the servant to do good and be beneficial to others. When this desire is present, the intention is firm, the determination is assured, and he seeks Allah&amp;rsquo;s help for it while undertaking things as they should be, then, by Allah&amp;rsquo;s will, he will count among the keys to goodness and the locks of evil.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>[NDT] This term has been interpreted in various ways by scholars. Some have affirmed that it refers to paradise, while others have advanced that it designates a tree in paradise whose shade extends a distance traveled in a hundred years, and from which the inhabitants of paradise draw their clothes, as explicit hadiths report. Another interpretation suggests that the root of this term evokes what is good, thus announcing a good life in this world and in the hereafter. This last explanation is the most exhaustive, as highlighted by Sheikh Mohammed Al &amp;lsquo;Othaymine, may Allah have mercy on him.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>[NDT] Al Fatah is one of the sublime names of Allah which encompasses several meanings. He is the one who judges between His servants with equity in this life and the hereafter, who grants assistance to the believers: &amp;ldquo;In Allah (Alone) we put our trust. Our Lord! Judge between us and our people in truth, for You are the best of those who judge&amp;rdquo; [Surah 7:39]. He is also the one who opens the doors of sustenance and mercies: &amp;ldquo;Whatever mercy (i.e., good) Allah may grant to mankind, none can withhold it, and whatever He may withhold, none can grant it thereafter. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.&amp;rdquo; [Surah 35, v.2].&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;He whom Allah wants to show kindness to, He instructs him in the religion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The greatest of the gates that saves the servant from perdition is faith in Allah, and
in all that He has ordered to be believed. Faith is Tawhid which constitutes Al Fiqh Al
Akbar, it is the greatest of understandings in the religion. The servant therefore needs
to know that his need for faith in Allah, and in all that He has commanded to be believed,
is more important than his need for food and drink.&lt;/p>

of Tawhid; the Tawhid of divinity in the souls of people, so that the goal of man is the
face of Allah and the ultimate dwelling in all his affairs. His worship, behavior,
relationships with others and all his affairs, because it is what is most important.
That man&amp;rsquo;s intention, hope, repent followed by good actions and return, be devoted to
Allah alone. And it is through this Tawhid, i.e. the divinity and worship, that the
servant attains happiness in this life and the hereafter.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That I swear by Allah while lying is preferable to me than to swear by anything else
while speaking the truth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a great saying by &amp;lsquo;Abd Allah Ibn Massou&amp;rsquo;d, may Allah be pleased with both of them.
It testifies to the perfect understanding of the companions, the special attention they
paid to Tawhid, and also the care given to the terms used, while taking care and warning
against it. He spoke these blessed great words, which show, as I said, the great
perception of the companions and the special attention they paid to the Tawhid of Allah.
He said, may Allah be pleased with him:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That I swear by Allah while lying is preferable to me than to swear by anything else
while speaking the truth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now meditate on the first word and the second, weigh them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first word: &amp;ldquo;That I swear by Allah while lying.&amp;rdquo; The second word: &amp;ldquo;Than to swear by
anything else while speaking the truth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compare the two words to observe this remarkable sagacity. Each of these two words
contains a good action and a bad one. The first phrase contains a good and a bad action.
Similarly, for the second, there is also a good action and a bad one. The first word: &amp;quot;
That I swear by Allah while lying,&amp;quot; there is the good action of Tawhid and the bad one
which is lying. For the second word &amp;ldquo;that to swear by anything else while speaking the
truth,&amp;rdquo; there is the bad action of Shirk and the good action of truthfulness. Now that
this reality has become manifest to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A word that contains the good action of Tawhid or the bad action of Shirk?! We seek refuge
in Allah from Shirk, we seek refuge in Allah from Shirk. If you look at the bad actions,
lying is less serious than Shirk. Similarly, the good action of Tawhid is more prominent
than that of truthfulness. Then note this intense perception, he said:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That I swear by Allah while lying is preferable to me than to swear by anything else
while speaking the truth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the oath by anything other than Allah is Shirk, and the great sin of Shirk is more
important and even more serious than that of lying. This is the perception of the
companions, may Allah be pleased with them.&lt;/p>

Allah has said (in a close approximation of His words):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What prevents their gifts from being accepted is their lack of belief in Allah and
His Messenger.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to Abi Hourayra, the Prophet ﷺ, said:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The first thing the servant will be judged on the day of resurrection is prayer, if it is
correct, then he will prosper and succeed. If it is incorrect, he will fail and
lose.&amp;rdquo; [Reported by Thirmidhi, who declared it good]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The preceding hadith from Abi Hourayra, may Allah be pleased with him, indicates that the
validity of prayer
implies the acceptance of all works, including the other pillars of Islam.&lt;/p>

He afflicts them with difficulty and harm, then welcomes them as refugees in His Tawhid.
They then sincerely invoke Him, devotionally worshiping Him alone, and place their hopes
in Him alone and their hearts are attached to Him and no one else. This gives rise to
complete trust in Allah, returning repentantly and obediently to Him, the sweetness of
faith and its taste, as well as renouncing shirk. This is even more beneficial for them
than being freed from affliction by illness, fear, hunger, drought, or even the arrival of
ease and the disappearance of difficulty in this worldly life. For all of these things are
worldly pleasures and benefits, which disbelievers can have much more than believers. But
what happens to the people of Tawhid, those who exclusively worship Allah, is more
grandiose than what words can express or the mind can detail. Each believer will have a
share of this according to their faith.&lt;/p>

Islam. For there is no Islam without purifying the hearts of this Chirk.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The twelve months of the year are comparable to the children of Ya&amp;rsquo;qoub. And the month of
Ramadan among the other months is like Youssouf among his brothers. In the same way that
Youssouf is the most beloved child with Ya&amp;rsquo;qoub, Ramadan is the most beloved month with
the Knower of the unseen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Youssouf&amp;rsquo;s brothers came relying on him to fill the gaps and remove the harms, after being
in error and fault. He welcomed them in the best way and improved their situations, he fed
them when they were hungry and allowed them to return home. So, one individual solved the
problems of eleven people. That is the month of Ramadan, we hope to regain our
shortcomings from other months and rectify the bad things, so that Allah grants us a good
end with joy and happiness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And another indication is that Ya&amp;rsquo;qoub regained his sight when he smelled Youssouf. He
became strong after being weak, seeing after being blind. This is also the case for the
sinner when he smells Ramadan.&lt;/p>

directed towards others besides Allah.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Messenger of Allah said:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Worship Allah and give Him no
partners.&amp;rdquo; [Reported by Al Tirmidhi, who deemed it good and authentic]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is evidence in this that some people worship Allah while giving partners to Him. So,
simply worshiping Allah is not enough to be considered a monotheist. It may be that the
person worships Allah and something else at the same time. And this is well known:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;And most of them believe in Allah only while they associate others with
Him.&amp;rdquo; [Surah 12, v.106]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Muslim must be cautious about this point. The main thing is not just that you worship
Allah, but that you also reject all worship directed towards others besides Allah.&lt;/p>
