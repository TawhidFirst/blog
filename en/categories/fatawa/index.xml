&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Honorable Cheikh, may Allah grant you success, does loving to see forbidden images that
can be found on phones, on the internet, and constantly desiring them, fall under the
forms of Shirk where the person becomes an idolater of these images?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="answer">Answer
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Yes, it is a form of Shirk of desire. A form of Shirk of desire because he desires these
images. These images take his heart, and he follows them as a result. It is a minor
form of Shirk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Questioner: He then asks, what is your helpful advice for the one who is afflicted with
this?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That he stays away from the vision of forbidden images, no matter where they may be. That
he stays away from their vision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Tell the believing men to lower their gaze.&amp;rdquo; [Surah 24, v.30]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So he should lower his gaze and not look at such things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The hearing, the sight, and the heart, about all those one will be
questioned.&amp;rdquo; [Surah 17, v.36]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will be questioned about your sight, your hearing and your heart.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The one who says that Allah has indeed sent His prophet Muhammad and that the basis of his
call is the call for good morals, taking as evidence his statement:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I have been sent to perfect the highest moral values or noble characters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How should we respond to him?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="answer">Answer
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The hadith is weak, it is not taken as an argument. This hadith is weak and it is not
taken as an argument. However, if it were authentic, then Tawhid is among the best of good
morals. On the other hand, Shirk constitutes the worst of bad morals, even if the hadith
is authentic.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Is it permissible to eat the food of people of innovation, knowing that this food is made
on the occasion of their innovation, such as the food made for the birth of the
Prophet ﷺ?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="answer">Answer
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>What is obligatory is to warn them to stay away from innovation and not to engage in
prohibited things. It is the responsibility of the person not to eat food made for
innovations or prohibited things. The person should not use this food, but rather inform
and warn against falling into this prohibited thing.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>May Allah be benevolent towards you and make you profitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A belief-related issue has left me confused, it concerns the request for invocation to a
deceased person. I found a statement from Cheikh Mohammed Bazmoul, may Allah preserve him,
which says in essence that the request for invocation to a deceased person near their
grave, without any attribution of the specificities of Allah, is considered as an
innovated Tawassoul and prohibited. After thorough research, I found this statement among
some people of knowledge who also affirm it, and there are people of knowledge who
consider it as major Shirk which takes one out of Islam. I hope for clarification on this
point, may Allah record your reward. Does the divergence rest on the question of whether
the dead can hear the living or not?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>May Allah be benevolent towards you and make you profitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="answer">Answer
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Indeed, as you have mentioned, there is a divergence among people of knowledge on this
question: the request for invocation to a deceased person. What appears, is that this is
major Shirk which takes one out of Islam. We seek refuge with Allah. Indeed, he has not
asked without having the conviction that he can respond, that he holds the ability to
respond to his wish. Otherwise, this is foolishness and transgression.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I questioned some scholars on this subject &lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. There is a statement from Cheikh Al Islam
in Al Fatawa, in which he mentioned three categories including this one. He qualified it
as innovation. However, he also said in Iqtidâ As-Sirât Al-Moustaqîm Moukhâlafat &amp;lsquo;Asshâb
Al-Djahîm, that this is what the Christians did with Jesus, and that it is an innovation.
We thus understand that the statement of Cheikh Al Islam in Al Fatawa denotes innovation
leading to the disbelief of its author, and not an innovation that does not reach the
degree of disbelief. We must understand this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Indeed, some scholars do not see the act of asking for invocation to the dead as major
Shirk, but rather an innovation and a path leading to Shirk. However, if it is said that
the dead can hear the living as some scholars have stated, this goes against the majority
of evidence, which suggests that the dead cannot hear. The only exceptions are specific
instances such as the sound of sandals leaving the cemeteries and the infidel dead at
Badr, as reported by Al Boukhary. Omar said to the prophet ﷺ: &amp;ldquo;Are you talking to dead
people?&amp;rdquo; The prophet ﷺ replied: &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t hear better than them&amp;rdquo; and in an authentic
hadith: &amp;ldquo;While he can hear the sound of their sandals.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, these are specific situations, and there is no general evidence for it. Allah
says:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You cannot make the dead hear&amp;rdquo; [Surah Al Naml, v.80]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You cannot make those in the graves hear&amp;rdquo; [Surah Fatir, v.22]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if it is affirmed that they hear, the question remains: are they capable of
responding to the person asking for invocation? Clearly, nobody says that. That&amp;rsquo;s why the
most correct opinion is that it&amp;rsquo;s a form of shirk, and refuge should be sought with
Allah.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>What are the degrees of religion, citing for each one its pillars?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>May Allah reward you well&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="answer">Answer
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The degrees of religion are three; Islam, faith and excellence as shown by the prophet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first degree, Islam which is the general degree. Its pillars are five in number :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the testimony that none is worthy of worship except Allah and that Mohammed is the
messenger of Allah;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the performance of prayer;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>giving the mandatory charity;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the fast of the month of Ramadan;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the pilgrimage to the sacred house.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Any work that Allah has legislated falls under Islam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second degree, faith. Its pillars are six in number :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>that you believe in Allah;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>his angels;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>his books;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>his messengers;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the day of judgment;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the good or bad destiny.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The third degree, excellence. It has a single pillar :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>its meaning is &amp;ldquo;that you worship Allah as if you see Him, because if you do not see Him,
He sees you&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All good works fall under Islam and faith. If the believer combines all apparent and
hidden works, he becomes a Muslim believer. And if he worships Allah as if he sees Him,
because if he does not see Him, Allah sees him, he becomes thus a Muslim believer and
Mouhsin (degree of excellence).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We ask Allah to grant us all success.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Often the statement that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah comes in implication of the
statement that no deity deserves worship except Allah [La ilaha ila Allah].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is meant by the statement that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And what is the wisdom in their reciprocal implications?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="answer">Answer
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Yes, the statement that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah is required along with the
statement that no deity deserves worship except Allah. This can be done either by
pronouncing both or by inclusion. If the statement that no deity deserves worship except
Allah is cited alone, then it includes the statement that Muhammad is the messenger of
Allah.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The statement that no deity deserves worship except Allah [La ilaha ila Allah] is not
valid without the statement that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. It is not accepted,
and the Islam of one who denies the message of Muhammad is not judged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The meaning of Muhammad is the messenger of Allah is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>recognition of his message both in an apparent and hidden way;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>obedience to what he ordered;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>making true what he informed;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>staying away from what he prohibited and reprimanded;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>that Allah should be worshipped only by what he legislated.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Also recognizing the universality of his message, intended for both jinns and humans. He
is the last prophet, there is no prophet after him until the day of judgement.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Is it permissible to swear by the Quran, meaning by this, the word which is an attribute
of Allah?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="answer">Answer
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>It is permissible to swear by the Quran, as long as the subject of the oath is the word of
Allah. The Quran is indeed the word of Allah, it says &amp;ldquo;By the Quran&amp;rdquo;, as it could say &amp;ldquo;By
the word of Allah&amp;rdquo;. Since the Quran is part of the word of Allah, the oath by the Quran is
therefore an oath made by one of the attributes of Allah. However, one does not swear by
the Mushaf. One does not say &amp;ldquo;By the Mushaf&amp;rdquo;, because it contains the word of Allah and
what is not part of it. It contains the written word of Allah, but also the ink, which is
created. The pages are also created, as well as the cover. There is in the Mushaf what is
not created and what is. That&amp;rsquo;s why you should not swear by the Mushaf. However, if the
oath is made by the Quran, in the sense of the word of Allah and not the Mushaf, then this
is valid.&lt;/p>
