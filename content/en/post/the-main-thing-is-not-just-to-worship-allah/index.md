The main thing is not just that you worship Allah, but that you also reject all worship
directed towards others besides Allah.

The Messenger of Allah said:

"Worship Allah and give Him no
partners." [Reported by Al Tirmidhi, who deemed it good and authentic]

There is evidence in this that some people worship Allah while giving partners to Him. So,
simply worshiping Allah is not enough to be considered a monotheist. It may be that the
person worships Allah and something else at the same time. And this is well known:

"And most of them believe in Allah only while they associate others with
Him." [Surah 12, v.106]

The Muslim must be cautious about this point. The main thing is not just that you worship
Allah, but that you also reject all worship directed towards others besides Allah.
