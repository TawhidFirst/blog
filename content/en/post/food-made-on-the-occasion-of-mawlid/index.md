## Question

Is it permissible to eat the food of people of innovation, knowing that this food is made
on the occasion of their innovation, such as the food made for the birth of the 
Prophet ï·º?

## Answer

What is obligatory is to warn them to stay away from innovation and not to engage in
prohibited things. It is the responsibility of the person not to eat food made for
innovations or prohibited things. The person should not use this food, but rather inform
and warn against falling into this prohibited thing.
