## Question

Is it permissible to swear by the Quran, meaning by this, the word which is an attribute
of Allah?

## Answer

It is permissible to swear by the Quran, as long as the subject of the oath is the word of
Allah. The Quran is indeed the word of Allah, it says "By the Quran", as it could say "By
the word of Allah". Since the Quran is part of the word of Allah, the oath by the Quran is
therefore an oath made by one of the attributes of Allah. However, one does not swear by
the Mushaf. One does not say "By the Mushaf", because it contains the word of Allah and
what is not part of it. It contains the written word of Allah, but also the ink, which is
created. The pages are also created, as well as the cover. There is in the Mushaf what is
not created and what is. That's why you should not swear by the Mushaf. However, if the
oath is made by the Quran, in the sense of the word of Allah and not the Mushaf, then this
is valid.
