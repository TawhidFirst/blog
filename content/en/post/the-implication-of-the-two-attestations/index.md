## Question

Often the statement that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah comes in implication of the
statement that no deity deserves worship except Allah [La ilaha ila Allah].

What is meant by the statement that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah?

And what is the wisdom in their reciprocal implications?

## Answer

Yes, the statement that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah is required along with the
statement that no deity deserves worship except Allah. This can be done either by
pronouncing both or by inclusion. If the statement that no deity deserves worship except
Allah is cited alone, then it includes the statement that Muhammad is the messenger of
Allah.

The statement that no deity deserves worship except Allah [La ilaha ila Allah] is not
valid without the statement that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. It is not accepted,
and the Islam of one who denies the message of Muhammad is not judged.

The meaning of Muhammad is the messenger of Allah is:
- recognition of his message both in an apparent and hidden way;
- obedience to what he ordered;
- making true what he informed;
- staying away from what he prohibited and reprimanded;
- that Allah should be worshipped only by what he legislated.

Also recognizing the universality of his message, intended for both jinns and humans. He
is the last prophet, there is no prophet after him until the day of judgement.
