## Question

What are the degrees of religion, citing for each one its pillars?

May Allah reward you well

## Answer

The degrees of religion are three; Islam, faith and excellence as shown by the prophet.

The first degree, Islam which is the general degree. Its pillars are five in number :
- the testimony that none is worthy of worship except Allah and that Mohammed is the 
messenger of Allah;
- the performance of prayer;
- giving the mandatory charity;
- the fast of the month of Ramadan;
- the pilgrimage to the sacred house.

Any work that Allah has legislated falls under Islam.

The second degree, faith. Its pillars are six in number :
- that you believe in Allah;
- his angels;
- his books;
- his messengers;
- the day of judgment;
- the good or bad destiny.

The third degree, excellence. It has a single pillar :
- its meaning is "that you worship Allah as if you see Him, because if you do not see Him, 
He sees you".

All good works fall under Islam and faith. If the believer combines all apparent and
hidden works, he becomes a Muslim believer. And if he worships Allah as if he sees Him,
because if he does not see Him, Allah sees him, he becomes thus a Muslim believer and
Mouhsin (degree of excellence).

We ask Allah to grant us all success.
