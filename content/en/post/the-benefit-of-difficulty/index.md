Among the signs of the completion of Allah's blessings on His believing servants is that
He afflicts them with difficulty and harm, then welcomes them as refugees in His Tawhid.
They then sincerely invoke Him, devotionally worshiping Him alone, and place their hopes
in Him alone and their hearts are attached to Him and no one else. This gives rise to
complete trust in Allah, returning repentantly and obediently to Him, the sweetness of
faith and its taste, as well as renouncing shirk. This is even more beneficial for them
than being freed from affliction by illness, fear, hunger, drought, or even the arrival of
ease and the disappearance of difficulty in this worldly life. For all of these things are
worldly pleasures and benefits, which disbelievers can have much more than believers. But
what happens to the people of Tawhid, those who exclusively worship Allah, is more
grandiose than what words can express or the mind can detail. Each believer will have a
share of this according to their faith.
