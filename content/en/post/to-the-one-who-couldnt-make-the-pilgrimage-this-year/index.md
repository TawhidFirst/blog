Ibn Rajab, may Allah have mercy on him, said:

"He who cannot stand at 'Arafat, let him keep away from the prohibitions of Allah by
staying within the limits that He has made known to him. He who cannot sleep at Muzdalifa,
let him sleep in obedience to Allah, so that he may be close to his Lord. He who couldn't
slaughter at Mina, let him slaughter his passion in order to achieve his wish. He who
can't reach the House of Allah because he is far away, let him direct himself towards the
Lord of the House, for He is closer to him than his jugular vein."
