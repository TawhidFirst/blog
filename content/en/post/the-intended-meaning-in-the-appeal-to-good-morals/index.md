## Question

The one who says that Allah has indeed sent His prophet Muhammad and that the basis of his
call is the call for good morals, taking as evidence his statement:

"I have been sent to perfect the highest moral values or noble characters."

How should we respond to him?

## Answer

The hadith is weak, it is not taken as an argument. This hadith is weak and it is not
taken as an argument. However, if it were authentic, then Tawhid is among the best of good
morals. On the other hand, Shirk constitutes the worst of bad morals, even if the hadith
is authentic.
