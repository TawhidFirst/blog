## Question

Honorable Cheikh, may Allah grant you success, does loving to see forbidden images that
can be found on phones, on the internet, and constantly desiring them, fall under the
forms of Shirk where the person becomes an idolater of these images ?

## Answer

Yes, it is a form of Shirk of desire. A form of Shirk of desire because he desires these
images. These images take his heart, and he follows them as a result. It is a minor 
form of Shirk.

Questioner: He then asks, what is your helpful advice for the one who is afflicted with
this?

That he stays away from the vision of forbidden images, no matter where they may be. That
he stays away from their vision.

"Tell the believing men to lower their gaze." [Surah 24, v.30]

So he should lower his gaze and not look at such things.

"The hearing, the sight, and the heart, about all those one will be
questioned." [Surah 17, v.36]

You will be questioned about your sight, your hearing and your heart.
